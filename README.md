Goal

Develop and deliver mock services for COR and Position Manager to enable QA teams to bypass UAT environments, increase test independence, and enhance system coverage.

â¸»

Description

Design and implement mock environments simulating COR and Position Manager behaviors, allowing QA teams to create and run automated tests without relying on external UAT systems. This will empower test teams to validate system reactions earlier in the lifecycle, identify potential integration issues, and reduce dependency-related delays. The goal supports faster feedback loops and contributes to more stable releases.
