’m not too concerned about his lack of Java experience. His background in C provides a strong foundation, and the core backend principles—such as data structures, design patterns, and architecture—are already well understood. These concepts translate well into Java, and he’s already covered Java at university, so it’s not entirely new to him.

The only notable gap is in testing mindset, but if the role is more focused on core development, I don’t see that being a major issue. Plus, we benefit from the fact that he’s also a capable UI developer, which adds useful versatility to the team.
