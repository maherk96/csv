Description

Continue expanding the QAP to support richer test reporting features, integration across all layers of the tech stack, and automated sign-off processes. This initiative directly supports Risk & Control by providing a consistent and auditable approach to test management. Through standardized data collection, real-time reporting, and systemized sign-offs, the platform helps reduce operational risk, ensures traceability of QA activities, and improves transparency for internal audits and compliance reviews.
