Strengthen QA governance and reduce system risk by expanding automated mock services and leveraging QAP to drive auditable, consistent test reporting across critical trading applications.

⸻

Description

Continue delivering reusable mock services for systems like COR and Position Manager to reduce reliance on unstable UAT environments and enable consistent, isolated testing. In parallel, scale the QAP platform to provide centralized visibility, improve defect traceability, and ensure robust audit trails. This supports Risk & Control by reducing integration risks, minimizing production issues through earlier validation, and enabling internal audit teams to trace testing history and decisions with full transparency. Together, these initiatives create a controlled, measurable, and proactive QA process that aligns with Citi’s risk management and regulatory obligations.
