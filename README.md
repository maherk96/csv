Risk & Control

Over the first half of the year, I’ve made it a priority to embed risk awareness and control practices into my daily work. I’ve consistently taken ownership of the quality and compliance of my deliverables, particularly by supporting robust code review processes across all QA teams. These reviews not only ensured the application of design patterns and maintainable code but also helped identify and resolve quality issues early in the development lifecycle. This has significantly contributed to reducing downstream risk and aligning with Citi’s Enterprise Risk Management Framework.

Additionally, I’ve been closely involved in enhancing our test reporting processes by strengthening QAP governance. Through the delivery of reusable mock services and the expansion of the QAP platform, I’ve helped create a more auditable and transparent testing ecosystem. 

Financial Performance

In support of our financial performance goals, I’ve focused on expanding the capabilities of the QAP platform to deliver measurable value. By contributing to the development of REST APIs that expose key test metrics, I’ve enabled teams to derive meaningful insights from their testing data — including failure rates, code coverage, and test execution trends. These insights have informed better prioritisation of work, reduced unnecessary rework, and supported more effective resource allocation across QA.

I also played a leading role in promoting mock service adoption to decouple testing from UAT environments. By identifying key integration points and delivering mocks tailored to those needs, we were able to increase test independence and significantly improve reliability. These efforts have led to faster feedback loops and shortened release cycles, ultimately reducing cost and improving overall efficiency. The automation of sign-off workflows and support for real-time reporting in QAP has further strengthened our financial control posture by reducing time spent on manual processes and audits.

Client & Franchise Outcomes

To deliver value aligned with Client & Franchise outcomes, I’ve focused on initiatives that improve collaboration, code reusability, and engineer development. I’ve developed and maintained shared utility libraries that encapsulate common QA functionality, helping teams reduce duplication and focus on meaningful test logic. These libraries are now widely used and have improved productivity and consistency across multiple projects.

Moreover, I have been instrumental in the design and delivery of reusable mock services that mirror the behaviour of complex internal systems like DSP and COR. This work has empowered QA teams to conduct automated testing independently of UAT environments, resulting in more reliable and timely releases for our internal clients. 

Lastly, I’ve invested time in upskilling fellow QA engineers. Whether through one-on-one mentoring sessions, code walkthroughs, or technical training, I’ve worked to build a culture of continuous learning and support. This has improved the team’s technical confidence and ensured consistent quality contributions across the board.

WHAT

Throughout the first half of 2025, the outcomes of my contributions have had a tangible impact across all three performance pillars.

Under the Risk & Control pillar, my focus on code quality and test governance has directly contributed to reducing operational risk. By consistently performing detailed code reviews across QA teams, I’ve helped uphold high standards for maintainability, stability, and compliance. This has made our test suites more robust, enabling earlier defect detection and ensuring traceability for audits. The expansion of QAP’s reporting features has strengthened our ability to demonstrate control effectiveness and support internal audit activities with full transparency.

From a Financial Performance perspective, while the QAP APIs are not yet fully utilised due to the absence of a functioning UI, the foundational work I’ve contributed has laid the groundwork for future efficiency gains. Once the UI is in place, these APIs will enable data-driven decision-making across teams by providing visibility into test coverage, failure trends, and execution metrics. In parallel, the reusable mocks I developed have already delivered value by reducing reliance on UAT environments, shortening test turnaround times, and removing blockers that previously impacted release schedules. These efforts are expected to significantly support cost optimisation as the platform matures.

In terms of Client & Franchise Outcomes, the work I’ve done around building shared utility libraries and reusable mock services has had a lasting positive effect. Teams are now more empowered to deliver high-quality results with reduced dependency on shared environments. The utilities have improved overall productivity by enabling code reuse and streamlining automation tasks. Furthermore, my mentoring and knowledge-sharing initiatives have supported the professional growth of QA engineers, increasing team capability and driving consistency in how we contribute to strategic platforms like QAP.

Overall, my work has supported stronger governance, faster and more cost-effective testing, and better collaboration across engineering teams.
