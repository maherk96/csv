I think the candidate shows a good thought process and a strong willingness to learn, which is definitely a positive. However, the fact that she couldn’t write a basic constructor was a bit worrying. If you’re specifically looking for someone with a stronger technical background, I wouldn’t be too confident in her ability to contribute immediately, though she may get up to speed over time with the right support.

It’s also worth pointing out that our framework is quite complex — it’s not front-end focused and we work with niche libraries like QuickFIX, TIBCO RV, and Solace. Debugging and solving dependency issues is a core part of the role, and that requires a certain level of technical fluency. Even Wajid, who seems more technically capable, will have a learning curve — it’ll likely be steeper for her.

We can definitely bring her in for a third-round interview focused more on testing, but if you’re not confident in her technically, I’m not sure how useful that would be in the long run.
