Advance the development of QAP to support performance analytics, trend monitoring, and cross-team visibility through accessible APIs — laying the groundwork for improved efficiency and smarter QA resource planning.

Description

While QAP is still being built out, we are actively expanding its capabilities to support financial performance goals through data transparency and intelligent automation. By offering a suite of REST APIs, we enable QA and development teams to extract valuable insights such as test trends, failure rates, class-level coverage, and baseline vs. release performance metrics. These insights are helping teams identify bottlenecks, reduce rework, and make more informed decisions — all of which contribute to better resource utilization and reduced cost across the tech stack. As we progress, QAP will play a critical role in aligning QA investment with measurable business value.
